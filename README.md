# 3D-model-reconstruction-from-image-sequence
This is my undergraduate design project

I complete this project on my Ubuntu virtural machine and I use a lot of existing libraries or softwares to solve some difficult parts in 3D reconstruction process. 
You can find some reference here http://www.10flow.com/2012/08/15/building-visualsfm-on-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin-desktop-64-bit/ to know how to set up these thing in your OS.
